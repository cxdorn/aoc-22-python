## Advent of Code 2022

This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code 2022 questions written in python. The solutions run in reasonable time, except for a few (including day 16 and day 22) which may take 15 minutes or so ... .

Most of my solutions just address Part II of each day's question, as I didn't have the foresight to preserve my Part I solutions and often simply overwrote them with my Part II solutions.

# Highlights of my AoC experience 

* learning about the different behaviours standard data structures in python (lists, sets, dicts, generators)
* learning about the usefulness `frozenset` and hashable types
* learning about the usefulness of `collections` (in particular, `defaultdict`) and `itertools` 
* learning about bitwise operations 
* solving the 'solve for 0' part of day 21 very fast using some of Newton's ideas
* solving the dfs search of day 19 fast with not-always-correct-but-still-reasonable constraints
